# mac-bootstrap

Warning: Current state is not working. not tested. no scripts run yet.

The reason for starting up this project was to have two identically configured Mac-Laptops. One at work and one at home.
My plan is to have them synced with python development and System adminisration tools.

Many files and configurations are taken from https://github.com/divio/osx-bootstrap
